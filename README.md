# My-Projects
**Repository contain my Data Analysis And Machine Learning Projects for an understanding of the process,Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.**
## Contents
* **Machine Learning**

  - [Gender prediction](https://github.com/Anas-coder/Project-Gender-Prediction) : A model to predict the gender of a person using their height and  weight.
  
  - [Diabetes predictor](https://github.com/Anas-coder/My-Projects/blob/master/Machine%20Learning%20Projects/(Project)%20on%20Diabetes%20%20Data.ipynb): Predicting Diabetes in       a patient using  attributes like Pregnancies	Glucose	BloodPressure	etc.
  
  - [Flower species prediction](https://github.com/Anas-coder/My-Projects/blob/master/Machine%20Learning%20Projects/Machine%20Learning%20with%20Iris%20Dataset.ipynb): The Iris       dataset is a classic dataset for classification, machine learning, and data visualization. In this notebook I'm going to do an end to end project of Machine Learning in         which we will take SepalLength, SepalWidth, PetalLength, PetalWidth an input and will predict the species of the flower.
  
  - [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Anas-coder/My-Projects/tree/master/Machine%20Learning%20Projects/Customer%20Churn):Predicting which set of the customers are       going to churn out from the organization by looking into some of the important attributes and applying Machine Learning algorithms on it.Similar concept with predicting         employee turnover, we are going to predict customer churn using telecom dataset.
  
  - [Addimision Prediction](https://github.com/Anas-coder/My-Projects/blob/master/Machine%20Learning%20Projects/Addimision%20Prediction.ipynb):Predicting the addmission of a         student using entrance marks.
  
>Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

* **Natural Language Processing**
  - 3-way Sentiment Analysis for Tweets: 3-way polarity (positive, negative, neutral) classification system for tweets, without using NLTK's sentiment analysis engine.

  -  Cross language Information Retrieval: Cross language information retrieval system (CLIR) which, given a query in German, searches text documents written in English.

>Tools: NLTK, scikit

* **Data Analysis and Visualisation**

  - [Big Market Sales Data Analysis](https://github.com/Anas-coder/My-Projects/blob/master/Data%20Analysis%20Projects/Big%20Market%20Sales%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb).: Analysis of     sales in Big market.
  - [Uber data analysis](https://github.com/Anas-coder/My-Projects/blob/master/Data%20Analysis%20Projects/(Project)Uber%20data%20set%20practice.ipynb): Exploratory Analysis of       uber data using  Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib visualisations.
  - [Movie lens data Analysis](https://github.com/Anas-coder/My-Projects/blob/master/Data%20Analysis%20Projects/Data%20Processing%20Example(Movie%20DATA%20)%20.ipynb): Analysis     of movie rating.
 
>Tools: Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib

* Micro Projects:
  - ML with Logistic Regression: Using Logistic Regression to predict whether an internet user clicked an ad or not.
  - ML with K Nearest Neighbours: Using KNN to classify instances from a fake dataset into two target classes, while choosing the best value for K using the elbow method.
  - ML with Decision Trees and Random Forests: Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict whether a lender will pay their loan back. Uses publically available data from     LendingClub.com
  - Movie Recommendations using Recommender Systems: A micro project to build a recommendation system that makes movie recommendations based on user review similarities.
