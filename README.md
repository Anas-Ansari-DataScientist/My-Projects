  - Predicting Boston Housing Prices: A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best     price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
  
  - Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML: Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual     makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.
  
  - Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments: Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse       product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.
  

  - Deep Learning: Digit Sequence Recognition using CNNs: Designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network that learns to recognize sequences of digits using synthetic       data generated by concatenating images from MNIST.
  
Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame
