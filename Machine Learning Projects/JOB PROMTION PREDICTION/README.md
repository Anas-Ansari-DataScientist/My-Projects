In this project I have used 3 Machine learning algorithm.

--Logistic Regression

-Random forest

-Decision Tree

>Tools: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy, NearMiss, sklearn

To evaluate my model I have used-

>classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score, F1 score, K-FOLD CROSS VALIDATION
