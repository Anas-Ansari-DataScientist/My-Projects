# Churn-Modelling-Dataset

Predicting which set of the customers are going to churn out from the organization by looking into some of the important attributes and applying Machine Learning algorithms on it.

Customer churn refers to when a customer (player, subscriber, user, etc.) ceases his or her relationship with a company. Online businesses typically treat a customer as churned once a particular amount of time has elapsed since the customer's last interaction with the site or service.

A Predictive Churn Model is a tool that defines the steps and stages of customer churn, or a customer leaving your service or product. ... But with an evolving churn model, you can fight for retention by acting on the metrics as they happen

Customer churn occurs when customers or subscribers stop doing business with a company or service, also known as customer attrition. It is also referred as loss of clients or customers. ... Similar concept with predicting employee turnover, we are going to predict customer churn using telecom dataset.

The dataset was collected from kaggle

For EDA I have used a library called pandas_profiling. With the help of this particular library I am able to understand the data in just few lines of code

I have used 2 machine learning model-

>Logistic Regression and
>Random Forest

I evaluated my working model by using F1 score,K-fold cross validation and through confusion matrix.

>Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy, pandas_profiling
